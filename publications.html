          We present the largest database for visual kinship recognition, <i>
            Families In the Wild </i>(FIW), with over 13,000 family photos of 1,000
          family trees with 4-to-38 members. It took only a small team to build
          FIW with efficient labeling tools and work-flow. To extend FIW, we
          further improved upon this process with a novel semi-automatic labeling
          scheme that used annotated faces and unlabeled text metadata to discover
          labels, which were then used, along with existing FIW data, for the
          proposed clustering algorithm that generated label proposals for all
          newly added data-- both processes are shared and compared in depth,
          showing great savings in time and human input required. Essentially, the
          clustering algorithm proposed is semi-supervised and uses labeled data
          to produce more accurate clusters. We statistically compare FIW to
          related datasets, which unarguably shows enormous gains in overall size
          and amount of information encapsulated in the labels. We benchmark two
          tasks, kinship verification and family classification, at scales
          incomparably larger than ever before. Pre-trained CNN models fine-tuned
          on FIW outscores other conventional methods and achieved
          state-of-the-art on the renowned KinWild datasets. We also measure human
          performance on kinship recognition and compare to a fine-tuned CNN.

          We tackle the challenging kinship classification problem. Different from kinship verification, which tells two
          persons have certain kinship relation or not, kinship classification aims to identify the family that a person
          belongs to. Beyond age and appearance gap across parents and children, the difficulties of kinship
          classification lie in that any data of the children to be classified are unavailable in advance to help
          training. To handle this challenge, an auxiliary database with complete parents and children modalities is
          employed to uncover the parent-children latent knowledge. Specifically, we propose a Latent Adaptive Subspace
          learning (LAS) to uncover the shared knowledge between two modalities so that the unseen test children are
          implicitly modeled as latent factors for kinship classification. Moreover, person-wise and family-wise
          constraints are designed to enhance the individual similarity and couple the parents and children within
          families for discriminative features. Comprehensive experiments on two large kinship datasets show that the
          proposed algorithm can effectively inherit knowledge from different databases and modalities and achieve the
          state-of-the-art performance.

            Recognizing Families In the Wild (RFIW) is a large-scale, multi-track
            automatic kinship recognition evaluation, supporting both kinship
            verification and family classification on scales much larger than ever
            before. It was organized as a Data Challenge Workshop hosted in
            conjunction with ACM Multimedia 2017. This was achieved with the largest
            image collection that supports kin-based vision tasks. In the end, we
            use this manuscript to summarize evaluation protocols, progress made and
            some technical background and performance ratings of the algorithms
            used, and a discussion on promising directions for both research and
            engineers to be taken next in this line of work.

            With our Families In the Wild (FIW) dataset, which consists of labels 1,
            000 families in over 12, 000 family photos, we benchmarked the largest
            kinship verification experiment to date. FIW, with its quality data and
            labels for full family trees found worldwide, more accurately is the
            true, global distribution of blood relatives with a total 378, 300 face
            pairs of 9 different relationship types. This gives support to tackle
            the problem with modern-day data-driven methods, which are imperative
            due to the complex nature of tasks involving visual kinship recognition-
            many hidden factors and less discrimination when considering face pairs
            of blood relatives. For this, we propose a denoising auto-encoder based
            robust metric learning (DML) framework and its marginalized version
            (mDML) to explicitly preserve the intrinsic structure of data and
            simultaneously endow the discriminative information into the learned
            features. Large-scale experiments show that our method outperforms other
            features and metric based approaches on each of the 9 relationship
            types.

            We present the largest kinship recognition dataset to date, Families in the Wild (FIW). Motivated by the
            lack
            of a single, unified dataset for kinship recognition, we aim to provide a dataset that captivates the
            interest of the research community. With only a small team, we were able
            to collect, organize, and label over 10,000 family photos of 1,000
            families with our annotation tool designed to mark complex hierarchical
            relationships and local label information in a quick and efficient
            manner. We include several benchmarks for two image-based tasks, kinship
            verification and family recognition. For this, we incorporate several
            visual features and metric learning methods as baselines. Also, we
            demonstrate that a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as an
            off-the-shelf feature extractor outperforms the other fea- ture types.
            Then, results were further boosted by fine-tuning two deep CNNs on FIW
            data: (1) for kinship verification, a triplet loss function was learned
            on top of the network of pre-train weights; (2) for family recognition,
            a family-specific softmax classifier was added to the network.

            There is an urgent need to organize and manage images of people
            automatically due to the recent explosion of such data on the Web in
            general and in social media in particular. Beyond face detection and
            face recognition, which have been extensively studied over the past
            decade, perhaps the most interesting aspect related to human-centered
            images is the relationship of people in the image. In this work, we
            focus on a novel solution to the latter problem, in particular the kin
            relationships. To this end, we constructed two databases: the first one
            named UB KinFace Ver2.0, which consists of images of children, their
            young parents and old parents, and the second one named FamilyFace.
            Next, we develop a transfer subspace learning based algorithm in order
            to reduce the significant differences in the appearance distributions
            between children and old parents facial images. Moreover, by exploring
            the semantic relevance of the associated metadata, we propose an
            algorithm to predict the most likely kin relationships embedded in an
            image. In addition, human subjects are used in a baseline study on both
            databases. Experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithms
            can effectively annotate the kin relationships among people in an image
            and semantic context can further improve the accuracy.

            Because of the inevitable impact factors such as pose, expression,
            lighting and aging on faces, identity verification through faces is
            still an unsolved problem. Research on biometrics raises an even
            challenging problem--is it possible to determine the kinship merely
            based on face images? A critical observation that faces of parents
            captured while they were young are more alike their children's compared
            with images captured when they are old has been revealed by genetics
            studies. This enlightens us the following research. First, a new kinship
            database named UB KinFace composed of child, young parent and old parent
            face images is collected from Internet. Second, an extended transfer
            subspace learning method is proposed aiming at mitigating the enormous
            divergence of distributions between children and old parents. The key
            idea is to utilize an intermediate distribution close to both the source
            and target distributions to bridge them and reduce the divergence.
            Naturally the young parent set is suitable for this task. Through this
            learning process, the large gap between distributions can be
            significantly reduced and kinship verification problem becomesmore
            discriminative. Experimental results show that our hypothesis on the
            role of young parents is valid and transfer learning is effective to
            enhance the verification accuracy.
