<meta name="description" content="Visual kinship recognition from facial images has grown to be a hot topic in the
 machine vision research community. At the core of motivation lies an abundance of practical uses, like issues of human
 trafficking and in missing children, problems from todayâ€™s refugee crises, and social media platforms. Use-cases exist
 for the academic world as well, whether for machine vision (e.g., reducing the search space in large-scale face
 retrieval) or a different field entirely (e.g., historical & genealogical lineage studies). However, to the best of our
 knowledge, no reliable system exists in practice. This is certainly not due to a lack of effort by researchers, as many
 works focused on kinship. Thus, there was a gap separating research-from-reality, which we had set out to fill. In the
 end, we filled this gap with Families In the Wild (FIW), the <b>largest<\b> and <b>most comprehensive<\b> image
 collection for kinship recognition.">
